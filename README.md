# Predicting-Real-Estate-Prices-Using-Linear-Regression
Description:

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating real estate prices using Linear Regression. The model will leverage historical data on various factors influencing property values, such as location, size, age, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, proximity to amenities, and market trends.

Key Objectives:

Build and train a Linear Regression model: Develop and train a machine learning model to accurately predict real estate prices based on the provided features.
Feature engineering: Select and engineer relevant features from the dataset to improve model accuracy and interpretability.
Model evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Analyze model results: Interpret the model coefficients to understand the impact of different features on property prices.
Develop a user-friendly interface: Create a simple interface (e.g., web application or script) where users can input property characteristics and receive a predicted price estimate.
Expected Outcomes:

A well-trained Linear Regression model capable of predicting real estate prices with reasonable accuracy.
A set of insights into the factors that most significantly influence property values in the target market.
A user-friendly tool that can be used by potential homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions.
Potential Challenges:

Data availability and quality: Obtaining a large, clean, and comprehensive dataset with relevant features can be challenging.
Model complexity: Linear Regression may not be able to capture complex, non-linear relationships between features and prices.
Overfitting: The model may overfit to the training data, leading to poor performance on unseen data.
Tools and Technologies:

Programming Languages: Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment (optional): Flask, Streamlit
